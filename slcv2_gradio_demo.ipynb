        "      <p>The app is built upon an <a href=\"https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.efficientnet_b3.html\" target=\"_blank\">EfficientNet_B3</a> architecture implemented by the Pytorch team. The model was fine-tuned on the <a href=\"https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T\" target=\"_blank\">HAM10000 dataset.</a></p>\n",
        "      <p>To address the class imbalances in the dataset the minority classes were oversampled by applying augmentations that I thought would reflect the nature of real-world photos taken with a smartphone: random rotations, horizontal/vertical flips, brightness adjustments, random blurring.</p>\n",
        "      <p>The example images in the demo come from <a href=\"https://dermnetnz.org\" target=\"_blank\">https://dermnetnz.org</a></p>\n",
        "      <p>If you want to take a look at the steps I took in developing the app check-out this <a href=\"https://github.com/mgrzb451/SkinLesionClassifier_v2\" target=\"_blank\">repository.</a> If you have any questions or suggestions create a new post in the <a href=\"link_to_discussions\" target=\"_blank\">Discussions.</a></p>\n",

        "      <p>I am very passionate about the art of coding and have been fascinated by the world of Artificial Intelligence. That said, I am not a programmer, nor do I have any formal education in computer science.</p>\n",
        "      <p>This project marks my first big step in a personal journey to teach myself Python, Machine Learning, and AI from scratch. It has, at times, been really difficult but also incredibly rewarding and I am more excited than ever for future challenges!</p>\n",
        "      <p>While my primary goal in developing this app was to deepen my understanding of programming and AI, I also wanted to create tangible value for others and make it as easily accessible as I could.</p>\n",
